_The health check outcome is DOWN._

And all states are listed as ""undefined"" though for example data of deployment-status shows ""OK"" and also server-state data is ""running"".

 

Directly accessing the health endpoint via HTTP ([http://localhost:9990/health)] shows this instead:

{{{""status"":""UP"",""checks"":[\{""name"":""deployments-status"",""status"":""UP"",""data"":{""test.ear"":""OK"",""test2.ear"":""OK""}},\{""name"":""boot-errors"",""status"":""UP""},\{""name"":""server-state"",""status"":""UP"",""data"":{""value"":""running""}},\{""name"":""ready-deployment.test2.ear.test2-web.war"",""status"":""UP""},\{""name"":""ready-deployment.test.ear.test-web.war"",""status"":""UP""}]}}}

So the endpoint shows all states as ""UP"" instead of HAL showing all states as ""undefined"" or ""DOWN"" (for the overall outcome).

I would expect HAL to show the same output as the health endpoint.

HAL-1716,"In WildFly 21.0.0, tried to create a simple Oracle XA datasource.

At step 3 (JDBC Driver), there is an optional field for ""Driver Class Name"" and the default supplied is ""oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver""

A driver class (i.e. an implementation of {{java.sql.Driver}}) *cannot be used* with an XA DataSource.
 * Instead an implementation of {{javax.sql.XADataSource}} must be supplied.
 * An XA DataSource class is required (it is *mandatory* not optional).
 * Even if the field retained the class (it doesn't - see below), it is confusing to call it a ""Driver Class Name"" as a ""Driver Class"" is distinctly different from an ""XADataSource Class"" (these are different Java interfaces). The two types cannot be used interchangeably.

Users should be prompted to provide an appropriate class for their specific driver (e.g. {{oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource}}). Supplying a default is not a good idea as it may change with driver releases.

I tried to substitute the XA class in the ""Driver Class Name"" field but the required configuration is missing (looks like the field is ignored). The required configuration needs to appear as below (with the provided class):

HAL-1681,"If you use properties in your configuration XML-s (standalone.xml, domain.xml, ...) than several functions become unusable in HAL.
In the source code of HAL, when it creates an operation for example like this

{code:java}
Operation operation = new Operation.Builder(address, READ_RESOURCE_OPERATION)
{code}

I couldn't find a case when it contains the line

{code:java}
.param(RESOLVE_EXPRESSIONS, true)
{code}

This will cause unresolved expressions to be returned and later numeric errors to be thrown while trying to read them. I attached two examples of this kind of error, which appeared on my console. Bellow I give full details of the case which is related to display runtime batch infos. If you check the following: 

[BatchPreview.java on GITHUB |https://github.com/hal/console/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/org/jboss/hal/client/runtime/subsystem/batch/BatchPreview.java]

{code:java}
    @Override
    public void update(SubsystemMetadata item) {
        ResourceAddress address = BATCH_SUBSYSTEM_TEMPLATE.resolve(statementContext);
        Operation operation = new Operation.Builder(address, READ_RESOURCE_OPERATION)
                .param(INCLUDE_RUNTIME, true)
                .param(RECURSIVE, true)
                .build();
        dispatcher.execute(operation, result -> {
            attributes.refresh(result);
            if (result.hasDefined(DEFAULT_THREAD_POOL)) {
                String name = result.get(DEFAULT_THREAD_POOL).asString();
                ModelNode threadPool = failSafeGet(result, THREAD_POOL + ""/"" + name);
                if (threadPool.isDefined()) {
                    Elements.setVisible(details, true);
                    int max = threadPool.get(MAX_THREADS).asInt();
                    int current = threadPool.get(CURRENT_THREAD_COUNT).asInt();
                    int largest = threadPool.get(LARGEST_THREAD_COUNT).asInt();
                    currentThreadCount.update(current, max);
                    largestThreadCount.update(largest, max);
                }
            }
        });
    }
{code}

You can see the line:
 
{code:java}
int max = threadPool.get(MAX_THREADS).asInt();
{code}

which causes the numeric error in the HAL browser app. If you add some logging this way:

{code:java}
logger.debug(""Batch CLI command: {} "", operation.asCli());
{code}

you can check the CLI equivalent of the operation:

{code:java}
/subsystem=batch-jberet:read-resource(include-runtime=true,recursive=true)
{code}

The right command should be:

{code:java}
/subsystem=batch-jberet:read-resource(include-runtime=true,recursive=true,resolve-expressions=true)
{code}

With the resolved expressions the asInt() method would not throw a numeric exception. To achieve this we should add:

{code:java}
.param(RESOLVE_EXPRESSIONS, true)
{code}

Unfortunately another error in the wildfly core must be corrected also, to fix this problem. In the wildfly core the read-resource operation does not resolve expressions recursively. An example for this:
 
{code:json}
[standalone@localhost:9992 /] /subsystem=batch-jberet:read-resource(include-runtime=true,recursive=true,resolve-expressions=true)
{
    ""outcome"" => ""success"",
    ""result"" => {
        ""restart-jobs-on-resume"" => true,
        ""security-domain"" => undefined,
        ""default-job-repository"" => ""in-memory"",
        ""default-thread-pool"" => ""batch"",
        ""in-memory-job-repository"" => {""in-memory"" => {}},
        ""jdbc-job-repository"" => undefined,
        ""thread-factory"" => undefined,
        ""thread-pool"" => {""batch"" => {
            ""active-count"" => 0,
            ""completed-task-count"" => 0L,
            ""current-thread-count"" => 0,
            ""keepalive-time"" => {
                ""time"" => 30L,
                ""unit"" => ""SECONDS""
            },
            ""largest-thread-count"" => 0,
            ""max-threads"" => expression ""${batch-max-threads}"",
            ""name"" => ""batch"",
            ""queue-size"" => 0,
            ""rejected-count"" => 0,
            ""task-count"" => 0L,
            ""thread-factory"" => undefined
        }}
    }
}
{code}

If you change location in the CLI, it will resolve the expression on the current level:

{code:json}
[standalone@localhost:9992 thread-pool=batch] :read-resource(include-runtime=true,resolve-expressions=true)
{
    ""outcome"" => ""success"",
    ""result"" => {
        ""active-count"" => 0,
        ""completed-task-count"" => 0L,
        ""current-thread-count"" => 0,
        ""keepalive-time"" => {
            ""time"" => 30L,
            ""unit"" => ""SECONDS""
        },
        ""largest-thread-count"" => 0,
        ""max-threads"" => ""111"",
        ""name"" => ""batch"",
        ""queue-size"" => 0,
        ""rejected-count"" => 0,
